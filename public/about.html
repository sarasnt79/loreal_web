          In 1909, Eugène Schueller, a young chemist with an entrepreneurial spirit, founded the company that was to become the L’Oréal Group. 
          It all began with one of the first hair dyes that he formulated, manufactured and sold to Parisian hairdressers. With this, the founder of 
          the Group forged the first link in what is still the DNA of L'Oréal: 
          research and innovation in the service of Beauty.
